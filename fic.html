            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <div class="body-parag">
                The Felixstowe International College Website project was a key step in my web development journey.
                I noticed the school's website was outdated and needed improvement.
                As a student learning web development, I saw this as a chance to apply my skills to a real problem.
                <br>
                <br>
                During summer break, I created a demo website and showed it to the school administration.
                They liked the idea and approved the project. This led to my first professional web development job,
                as the school offered me a part-time contract to complete the work.
                <br>
                <br>
                The project involved completely redesigning and rebuilding the school's website.
                It was a great opportunity for me to use what I had learned and gain practical experience.
                This project helped me grow as a developer while providing a valuable service to my school.
