    <h3>What Ye Is Doing — And Why People Don’t Get It</h3>
    <p><strong>Kanye West released a song called <em>Heil Hitler</em></strong>. It got pulled from platforms. People called him antisemitic, insane, dangerous. Media pushed the same narrative they’ve been using for years: Ye has lost it.</p>
    
    <h4>This Isn’t Random</h4>
    <p>Ye knows what he’s doing. He’s using shock to force attention. The title <em>Heil Hitler</em> isn’t about supporting Nazis. It’s about pushing a boundary so hard that you’re forced to ask: <em>Why did he go this far?</em></p>
    
    <h4>It’s About Ownership</h4>
    <p>The music industry is built on Black talent and white ownership. Most Black artists don’t own their masters. The culture is used, sold, and recycled—while wealth stays in the hands of people outside of it.</p>
    
    <h4>Selective Outrage</h4>
    <p>You can put out music full of violence, misogyny, and gang references—no problem. That gets awards and ad placements. But criticize the system behind it? Touch certain power structures? That gets pulled immediately.</p>
    
    <h4>It’s a System Thing, Not a People Thing</h4>
    <p>What Ye is pointing at isn’t about individuals. It’s about the structure. The industry runs on exploitation, and he’s highlighting how deep that goes. The backlash proves the point. He says one thing they don’t like, and they move to silence him completely.</p>
    
    <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
    <p>You don’t have to agree with Ye’s tactics. But what he’s doing is deliberate. He’s showing how far the system will go to protect itself. He’s putting himself in the fire to make it visible.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Most people won’t get it. They’ll just call him crazy. That’s the point.</strong></p>
