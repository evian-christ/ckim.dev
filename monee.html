            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <div class="body-parag">
                <b>m0nee</b> is a personal expense tracking application that helps users manage their finances efficiently.
                It allows users to record expenses, categorise them, and view summaries and visualisations.
                Built using Python and Tkinter, m0nee is a practical tool for managing personal finances.
                <br>
                The main motivation for creating m0nee stemmed from my move to London,
                where I felt a strong need to manage and track my expenses.
                I wanted to allocate a budget to specific categories I created and rate each expense to gain insightful data
                about my spending habits. Initially, I used an Excel spreadsheet for this purpose,
                but soon realised the need for a more tailored solution. This led to the development of m0nee,
                which I also wanted to share with others who have similar needs.

            <h2>Key Learnings and Challenges</h2>
            <div class="body-parag">
                <ol>
                    <li><b>1. GUI Design with Tkinter:</b><div>Developing a responsive and easy-to-use interface
                        improved my skills in widget layout and event handling.</div></li><br>
                    
                    <li><b>2. Database Management with SQLite:</b><div>Designing the database schema and implementing CRUD operations
                        deepened my understanding of database management and SQL.</div></li><br>
                    
                    <li><b>3. Backend Structure and Event Handling:</b><div>Structuring the backend to handle different functionalities efficiently
                        was a significant learning experience. I used modular programming to
                        separate concerns into different files and functions. For example,
                        separate modules handle adding expenses, viewing expenses, and managing settings.
                        Event handling was crucial for maintaining smooth interactions between
                        different parts of the application. I implemented callback functions and protocol
                        handlers to ensure the application responded correctly to user actions,
                        like closing a window or submitting a form.</div></li>
                    
                </ol>
            </div>
            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
