            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <div class="body-parag">
                The Felixstowe International College Website project was a significant milestone
                in my journey as a developer. The project involved revamping the outdated and poorly
                maintained website of Felixstowe International College. It started as a self-initiated
                summer project, which later turned into a part-time contract with the school,
                marking my first real-world web development experience.
                <br>
                As I was nearing graduation, I developed a keen interest in web development
                and was teaching myself various technologies. I noticed my school’s website
                was outdated and lacked proper maintenance. During the summer, I created a demo website
                and presented it to the school. They approved the project, which led to a part-time contract,
                benefiting both the school and myself.
                This project was an excellent opportunity to tackle a real-world problem while honing
                my web development skills.
